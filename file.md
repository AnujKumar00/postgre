## Introduction of PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

Being an open-source software, its source code is available under PostgreSQL license, a liberal open source license. Anyone with the right skills is free to use, modify, and distribute PostgreSQL in any form. As it is highly stable, very low effort is required to maintain this DBMS.

## What is Database

A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data, and they can be used to support a wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis, and data management. There are many different types of databases, including relational databases and NoSQL databases, and they can be used in a variety of settings, including business, scientific, and government organizations.

## Database vs DBMS

**Database:** A database is an organized collection of structured data or information, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It can include tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects that hold and manage data

Example :- Customer data (Name, Address & Contact No.)

</br>

**DBMS (Database Management System):** It is a software that provides an interface for users to interact with databases. It allows users to create, manage, manipulate, and query databases efficiently.DBMS handles tasks such as data storage, retrieval, updating, security, and data integrity

Example :- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MOngoDB, Oracle Database. 

</br>

## What is RDBMS?

A type of database system that stores data in structured tables (using rows and columns) and uses SQL (Structure query language) for managing and quering data.

Example :-
